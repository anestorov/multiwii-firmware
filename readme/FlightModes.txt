Information about settings and modes for GPS fixedwing
=======================================================

The code can be used on ATmega and ATmega 328P
Nano/Micro/Leonardo FC is too small to fit the Navigation code.

Supported models
* FLYING_WING
* AIRPLANE

NEW Function
  Keep current Heading.(Cruise mode.)
  Activate CRUISE.
  The plane will set a Hold Position in the current Heading and altitude.
  Distance to the point will be set by SAFE_WP_DISTANCE.
  If AP_MODE is used it will be moved every time you move sticks.
  Remember to change FENCE_DISTANCE

Some magic for running ATmega 328P processors
*********************************************
  Non MEGA boards is detected Automatically and activates a SLIM_WING
  Disables MAG, BARO and some code To fit in Promini

In MissionPlanner this Modes is supported but need to be verified.
  MISSION_WAYPOINT  - OK
  MISSION_JUMP      - ?
  MISSION_RTH       - ?

Modes not supported by SLIM_WING and will result in PosHold.
Should work on Mega FC's but needs to be verified.
  MISSION_HOLD_TIME
  MISSION_HOLD_UNLIM
  MISSION_SET_POI   ( Totally crazy function on planes... )
  MISSION_LAND
    Will put the plane in Poshold and descend.(Not tested by should work...)
    Needs another Sequence for a proper Airplane landing.

Other Parameters that also controls your plane.
*******************************************
Setings available in EOS Wingui
http://eosbandi.com/downloads/
And in config.h
*******************************************

Starts a RTH if plane fly away.  set to zero to disable
Abort by Manually switching to RTH on TX once
  FENCE_DISTANCE    600

If distance to next waypoint is to far Mission is aborted.
  SAFE_WP_DISTANCE  500

How small Radius can we hit? (100 is OK with a 10Hz gps)
  GPS_WP_RADIUS     200  // Cm Radius
  (Modified to dynamic size for FixedWing based on speed)

Max allowed navigation altitude ABS limit
  MAX_NAV_ALTITUDE  100

RTH minimum altitude during RTH
  RTH_ALTITUDE       50

Move the PosHold if Roll/Elevator sticks is moved. (Also in cruise)
#define AP_MODE      40
